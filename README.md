# Projects
1) ClosedLoopForm.py: Carbig dataset was used to implement linear regression. “Weight” as the predictor and “Horsepower” as the target variables were used. It was done using Closed-form solution
2) GradientDescent.py: In this, linear regression on the Carbig data set was implemented using Gradient descent.
3) Project2.py: The trend of root mean square error was plotted with respect to the complexity of the model.
4) Project_3.py: Trend of bias, variance and test error with respect to regularization parameter is plotted.
5) logistic_regression_classification.py: Coded the mathematical logic behind the logistic regression model and implemented it on iris    dataset using k-cross and achieved accuracy of 97% and also validated our model on a synthetic dataset.
