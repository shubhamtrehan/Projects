# Projects
1) ClosedLoopForm.py: Carbig dataset was used to implement linear regression. “Weight” as the predictor and “Horsepower” as the target variables were used. It was done using Closed-form solution
2) GradientDescent.py: In this, linear regression on the Carbig data set was implemented using Gradient descent.
3) Project2.py: The trend of root mean square error was plotted with respect to the complexity of the model.
4) Project_3.py: Trend of bias, variance and test error with respect to regularization parameter is plotted.
5) logistic_regression_classification.py: Coded the mathematical logic behind the logistic regression model and implemented it on iris        dataset using k-cross and achieved accuracy of 97% and also validated our model on a synthetic dataset.
6) Regression with various Models: In this problem, salary of an employee was to be deteremined given the experience of the employee.        Regression models like Support Vector Regression, Decision Trees, linear regression, polynomial regression were implemented using   sklearn in python. Before fitting into the models, the data was preprocessed using sklearn.preprocessing. Comment all other models to implement a single model.
7) Classification with various models: In this problem, the advertisement was to be classified so that a particular age group could be targeted to improve the sales. Classification models like Logistics regreesion, K-NN, SVM, kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest were implemented. Comment all other models to implement a single model.
